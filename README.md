# Vacationer
## Vacation planning and sharing

### Concept
Vacationer is a comprehensive vacation-planning application. Users are able to create multiple vacations and populate itineraries within each. Itineraries can include date, specific time, and an activity description. Users can log their vacations to their Google account so they are accessible from any device.  When a vacation city is clicked, current weather, an interactive map, and location photos populate. 

### Getting Started
To start using the site, users sign in to their Google account. Next, users can type in a vacation location in the primary input bar to create a new vacation. Once inside that vacation, users can begin adding to their itinerary. To switch to a different vacation, users can click the vacation city name in the navigation bar.

### Design
This website was designed using the Materialize CSS library.
